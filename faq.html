    <h1>What is the best time to travel to India?</p>
    <h3>The diverse topography of India comprises mountains, beaches, and deserts. The large size of the country also blesses it with different climatic conditions, which means that, while some places in India may have the mercury rising in the summers, there are some, 
        where the weather is cool and pleasant. Therefore, the best time to travel to India depends on the places a tourist would like to visit in the country. However, it is also safe to say that the winter season (October - March) is mostly preferred by the tourists while visiting India.
For wildlife sightings, both summer (March-mid June) and winter seasons are favourable. While the winter season is best for sighting animals basking in the sun during the day time, summer is the time when they can be seen frequently paying a visit to the water holes.</p>
